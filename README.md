A powerful AI-driven engine that automates the creation of Machine Learning models. Simply provide your dataset, and [Project Name] will design, train, and optimize a custom ML model tailored to your data.

🌟 Key Features
Data-Centric Architecture: Automatically detects data types and preprocessing requirements.

Automated Model Selection: Evaluates multiple algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, etc.) to find the best fit.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Uses [mention method, e.g., Bayesian Optimization] to squeeze out every bit of accuracy.

One-Click Export: Download your trained model as a .pkl or .onnx file for immediate deployment.

🛠️ How It Works
The system follows a streamlined pipeline to transform raw data into a production-ready model:

Data Ingestion: Upload xlxs/csv datasets.

Auto-Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encoding, and scaling.

Model Synthesis: The AI agent selects the architecture.

Evaluation: Generates detailed reports (Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix).

📊 Performance Visualization
The project includes built-in visualization tools to help you understand your new model's performance:
